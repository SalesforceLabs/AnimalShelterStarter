2. Once created, right-click on the force-app folder and select "SFDX: Deploy Source to Org". This will deploy the current package source to the scratch org.
3. Make required changes in the scratch org.
4. Pull changes back to VSCode by using the command pallette and select "SFDX: Pull Source from Default Org and override conflicts".
5. Switch to GitHub Desktop and provide details for the changes and then push the changes back to GitHub.
6. Once you are happy with your changes, re-open the GitHub page and create a Pull Request for your feature branch back to the master branch.
