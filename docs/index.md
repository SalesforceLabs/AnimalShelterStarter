## Introduction

Animal Shelter Starter Pack provides the foundation to use Salesforce for managing animals, treatments, conditions, housing and related activities.

The team within Salesforce.org have configured Animal, Action, Condition, Adoption and Exercise objects, along with Flows and Automation which you can install and adapt to your requirements, in addition, these are already linked to standard objects within Salesforce, such as Contacts and Accounts.

Animal Shelter Starter Pack is built to scale with your organisation, providing you with a foundation to begin managing your animals from rescue to recovery and beyond. Utilising the Salesforce platform, you will be able to take full control of your operations with the power of the worldâ€™s leading CRM.
